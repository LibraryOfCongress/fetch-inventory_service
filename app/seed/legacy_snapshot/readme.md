## About

This empty directory is maintained as a place to drop `.text` csv files used in migration from a legacy system to the FETCH system.

References in the seed.py script expects snapshot files to be dropped here.
Files should not be committed as they are both large (would require git LFS),
and would grow stale / irrelevant over time.

For legacy data migration documentation, see the root level ReadMe section titled `Migrating A Legacy Database`.
